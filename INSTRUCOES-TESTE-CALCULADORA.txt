🔍 INSTRUCTIONS TO TEST THE ROI CALCULATOR - STEP BY STEP 🔍

📋 IDENTIFIED ISSUE:
The "Calculate ROI" button is not working on the main page.

🔧 SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED:
1. ✅ Added debug logs to identify issues
2. ✅ Created a simple test file (teste-calculadora.html)
3. ✅ Improved the calculator initialization in JavaScript
4. ✅ Added fallbacks to ensure it runs

📱 HOW TO TEST:

STEP 1: Open the main page
- Open the file index.html in your browser
- Press F12 to open developer tools
- Go to the "Console" tab

STEP 2: Check debug messages
- In the console you should see messages like:
  🔍 DOMContentLoaded: Checking if ROI calculator can be initialized...
  ✅ roi-employees element found, initializing calculator...
  ✅ ROI Calculator initialized successfully

STEP 3: Test the button
- Scroll to the section "ROI CALCULATOR"
- Fill the fields with numbers (e.g.: 1000, 51, 5010, 20, 25)
- Click the "🧮 Calculate My ROI" button
- Confirm you see "⏳ Calculating..." and then the results

STEP 4: If it doesn't work, use the test file
- Open teste-calculadora.html in the browser
- This file is simpler and helps identify issues
- Click "🔍 Test ROICalculator Class"

🚨 POSSIBLE ISSUES & SOLUTIONS:

ISSUE 1: "Calculator was not initialized"
SOLUTION: Check if advanced-features.js is being loaded

ISSUE 2: "roi-employees element not found"
SOLUTION: Verify the HTML and element IDs are correct

ISSUE 3: "JavaScript error in the console"
SOLUTION: Copy and paste the error for analysis

ISSUE 4: Button clicks but nothing happens
SOLUTION: Check if the event listener was added correctly

🔍 TECHNICAL CHECKS:

1. ✅ HTML: Button with ID "calculate-roi-btn" exists
2. ✅ JavaScript: ROICalculator class is implemented
3. ✅ Event Listeners: Are added automatically
4. ✅ Initialization: Multiple fallbacks implemented

📞 IF STILL NOT WORKING:

1. Open the browser console (F12)
2. Copy ALL error messages
3. Send the messages to me for analysis
4. Test the teste-calculadora.html file separately

🎯 EXPECTED RESULT:
- Button should show "⏳ Calculating..." for 1 second
- Then it should display the calculated results
- Annual savings, investment and ROI should appear
- Chart should be updated with the data

💡 IMPORTANT TIP:
Always check the browser console (F12) for debug or error messages that help identify issues!
